  <title>Description</title>

  <para>
   The <command>CREATE POLICY</command> command defines a new row-level
   security policy for a table.  Note that row-level security must be
   enabled on the table (using <command>ALTER TABLE ... ENABLE ROW LEVEL
   SECURITY</command>) in order for created policies to be applied.
  </para>

  <para>
   A policy grants the permission to select, insert, update, or delete rows
   that match the relevant policy expression.  Existing table rows are
   checked against the expression specified in <literal>USING</literal>,
   while new rows that would be created via <literal>INSERT</literal>
   or <literal>UPDATE</literal> are checked against the expression specified
   in <literal>WITH CHECK</literal>.  When a <literal>USING</literal>
   expression returns true for a given row then that row is visible to the
   user, while if false or null is returned then the row is not visible.
   When a <literal>WITH CHECK</literal> expression returns true for a row
   then that row is inserted or updated, while if false or null is returned
   then an error occurs.
  </para>

  <para>
   For <command>INSERT</command> and <command>UPDATE</command> statements,
   <literal>WITH CHECK</literal> expressions are enforced after
   <literal>BEFORE</literal> triggers are fired, and before any actual data
   modifications are made.  Thus a <literal>BEFORE ROW</literal> trigger may
   modify the data to be inserted, affecting the result of the security
   policy check.  <literal>WITH CHECK</literal> expressions are enforced
   before any other constraints.
  </para>

  <para>
   Policy names are per-table.  Therefore, one policy name can be used for many
   different tables and have a definition for each table which is appropriate to
   that table.
  </para>

  <para>
   Policies can be applied for specific commands or for specific roles.  The
   default for newly created policies is that they apply for all commands and
   roles, unless otherwise specified.  If multiple policies apply to a given
   statement, they will be combined using OR (although <literal>ON CONFLICT DO
   UPDATE</> and <literal>INSERT</> policies are not combined in this way, but
   rather enforced as noted at each stage of <literal>ON CONFLICT</> execution).
  </para>

  <para>
   For commands that can have both <literal>USING</literal>
   and <literal>WITH CHECK</literal> policies (<literal>ALL</literal>
   and <literal>UPDATE</literal>), if no <literal>WITH CHECK</literal>
   policy is defined, then the <literal>USING</literal> policy will be used
   both for which rows are visible (normal <literal>USING</literal> case)
   and for which rows will be allowed to be added (<literal>WITH
   CHECK</literal> case).
  </para>

  <para>
   If row-level security is enabled for a table, but no applicable policies
   exist, a <quote>default deny</> policy is assumed, so that no rows will
   be visible or updatable.
  </para>

   <varlistentry>
    <term><replaceable class="parameter">name</replaceable></term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      The name of the policy to be created.  This must be distinct from the
      name of any other policy for the table.
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </varlistentry>

   <varlistentry>
    <term><replaceable class="parameter">table_name</replaceable></term>

   </varlistentry>

   <varlistentry>
    <term><replaceable class="parameter">command</replaceable></term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      The command to which the policy applies.  Valid options are
      <command>ALL</command>, <command>SELECT</command>,
      <command>INSERT</command>, <command>UPDATE</command>,
      and <command>DELETE</command>.
      <command>ALL</command> is the default.
      See below for specifics regarding how these are applied.
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </varlistentry>

   <varlistentry>
    <term><replaceable class="parameter">role_name</replaceable></term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      The role(s) to which the policy is to be applied.  The default is
      <literal>PUBLIC</literal>, which will apply the policy to all roles.
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </varlistentry>

   <varlistentry>
    <term><replaceable class="parameter">using_expression</replaceable></term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Any <acronym>SQL</acronym> conditional expression (returning
      <type>boolean</type>).  The conditional expression cannot contain
      any aggregate or window functions.  This expression will be added
      to queries that refer to the table if row level security is enabled.
      Rows for which the expression returns true will be visible.  Any
      rows for which the expression returns false or null will not be
      visible to the user (in a <command>SELECT</>), and will not be
      available for modification (in an <command>UPDATE</>
      or <command>DELETE</>).  Such rows are silently suppressed; no error
      is reported.

   <varlistentry>
    <term><replaceable class="parameter">check_expression</replaceable></term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Any <acronym>SQL</acronym> conditional expression (returning
      <type>boolean</type>).  The conditional expression cannot contain
      any aggregate or window functions.  This expression will be used in
      <command>INSERT</command> and <command>UPDATE</command> queries against
      the table if row level security is enabled.  Only rows for which the
      expression evaluates to true will be allowed.  An error will be thrown
      if the expression evaluates to false or null for any of the records
      inserted or any of the records that result from the update.  Note that
      the <replaceable class="parameter">check_expression</replaceable> is
      evaluated against the proposed new contents of the row, not the
      original contents.

   <title>Per-Command Policies</title>

   <variablelist>

     <varlistentry id="SQL-CREATEPOLICY-ALL">
      <term><literal>ALL</></term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
         Using <literal>ALL</literal> for a policy means that it will apply
         to all commands, regardless of the type of command.  If an
         <literal>ALL</literal> policy exists and more specific policies
         exist, then both the <literal>ALL</literal> policy and the more
         specific policy (or policies) will be combined using
         OR, as usual for overlapping policies.
         Additionally, <literal>ALL</literal> policies will be applied to
         both the selection side of a query and the modification side, using
         the <literal>USING</literal> expression for both cases if only
         a <literal>USING</literal> expression has been defined.
       </para>
       <para>
         As an example, if an <literal>UPDATE</literal> is issued, then the
         <literal>ALL</literal> policy will be applicable both to what the
         <literal>UPDATE</literal> will be able to select as rows to be
         updated (applying the <literal>USING</literal> expression),
         and to the resulting updated rows, to check if they are permitted
         to be added to the table (applying the <literal>WITH CHECK</literal>
         expression, if defined, and the <literal>USING</literal> expression
         otherwise).  If an <command>INSERT</command>
         or <command>UPDATE</command> command attempts to add rows to the
         table that do not pass the <literal>ALL</literal>
         policy's <literal>WITH CHECK</literal> expression, the entire
         command will be aborted.
       </para>
      </listitem>
     </varlistentry>

     <varlistentry id="SQL-CREATEPOLICY-SELECT">
      <term><literal>SELECT</></term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
         Using <literal>SELECT</literal> for a policy means that it will apply
         to <literal>SELECT</literal> queries and whenever
         <literal>SELECT</literal> permissions are required on the relation the
         policy is defined for.  The result is that only those records from the
         relation that pass the <literal>SELECT</literal> policy will be
         returned during a <literal>SELECT</literal> query, and that queries
         that require <literal>SELECT</literal> permissions, such as
         <literal>UPDATE</literal>, will also only see those records
         that are allowed by the <literal>SELECT</literal> policy.
         A <literal>SELECT</literal> policy cannot have a <literal>WITH
         CHECK</literal> expression, as it only applies in cases where
         records are being retrieved from the relation.
       </para>
      </listitem>
     </varlistentry>

     <varlistentry id="SQL-CREATEPOLICY-INSERT">
      <term><literal>INSERT</></term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
         Using <literal>INSERT</literal> for a policy means that it will apply
         to <literal>INSERT</literal> commands.  Rows being inserted that do
         not pass this policy will result in a policy violation error, and the
         entire <literal>INSERT</literal> command will be aborted.
         An <literal>INSERT</literal> policy cannot have
         a <literal>USING</literal> expression, as it only applies in cases
         where records are being added to the relation.
       </para>
       <para>
         Note that <literal>INSERT</literal> with <literal>ON CONFLICT DO
         UPDATE</literal> checks <literal>INSERT</literal> policies'
         <literal>WITH CHECK</literal> expressions only for rows appended
         to the relation by the <literal>INSERT</literal> path.
       </para>
      </listitem>
     </varlistentry>

     <varlistentry id="SQL-CREATEPOLICY-UPDATE">
      <term><literal>UPDATE</></term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
         Using <literal>UPDATE</literal> for a policy means that it will apply
         to <literal>UPDATE</literal> commands (or auxiliary <literal>ON
         CONFLICT DO UPDATE</literal> clauses of <literal>INSERT</literal>
         commands).  Since <literal>UPDATE</literal> involves pulling an
         existing record and then making changes to some portion (but
         possibly not all) of the record, <literal>UPDATE</literal>
         policies accept both a <literal>USING</literal> expression and
         a <literal>WITH CHECK</literal> expression.
         The <literal>USING</literal> expression determines which records
         the <literal>UPDATE</literal> command will see to operate against,
         while the <literal>WITH CHECK</literal> expression defines which
         modified rows are allowed to be stored back into the relation.
       </para>

       <para>
         When an <literal>UPDATE</literal> command is used with a
         <literal>WHERE</literal> clause or a <literal>RETURNING</literal>
         clause, <literal>SELECT</literal> rights are also required on the
         relation being updated and the appropriate <literal>SELECT</literal>
         and <literal>ALL</literal> policies will be combined (using OR for any
         overlapping <literal>SELECT</literal> related policies found) with the
         <literal>USING</literal> clause of the <literal>UPDATE</literal> policy
         using AND.  Therefore, in order for a user to be able to
         <literal>UPDATE</literal> specific rows, the user must have access
         to the row(s) through a <literal>SELECT</literal>
         or <literal>ALL</literal> policy and the row(s) must pass
         the <literal>UPDATE</literal> policy's <literal>USING</>
         expression.
       </para>

       <para>
         Any rows whose updated values do not pass the
         <literal>WITH CHECK</literal> expression will cause an error, and the
         entire command will be aborted.  If only a <literal>USING</literal>
         clause is specified, then that clause will be used for both
         <literal>USING</literal> and <literal>WITH CHECK</literal> cases.
       </para>

       <para>
         Note, however, that <literal>INSERT</literal> with <literal>ON CONFLICT
         DO UPDATE</literal> requires that an <literal>UPDATE</literal> policy
         <literal>USING</literal> expression always be enforced as a
         <literal>WITH CHECK</literal> expression.  This
         <literal>UPDATE</literal> policy must always pass when the
         <literal>UPDATE</literal> path is taken.  Any existing row that
         necessitates that the <literal>UPDATE</literal> path be taken must
         pass the (<literal>UPDATE</literal> or <literal>ALL</literal>)
         <literal>USING</literal> qualifications (combined using OR), which
         are always enforced as <literal>WITH CHECK</literal>
         options in this context.  (The <literal>UPDATE</literal> path will
         <emphasis>never</> be silently avoided; an error will be thrown
         instead.)  Finally, the final row appended to the relation must pass
         any <literal>WITH CHECK</literal> options that a conventional
         <literal>UPDATE</literal> is required to pass.
       </para>
      </listitem>

     <varlistentry id="SQL-CREATEPOLICY-DELETE">
      <term><literal>DELETE</></term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
         Using <literal>DELETE</literal> for a policy means that it will apply
         to <literal>DELETE</literal> commands.  Only rows that pass this
         policy will be seen by a <literal>DELETE</literal> command.  There can
         be rows that are visible through a <literal>SELECT</literal> that are
         not available for deletion, if they do not pass the
         <literal>USING</literal> expression for
         the <literal>DELETE</literal> policy.
       </para>

       <para>
         When a <literal>DELETE</literal> command is used with a
         <literal>WHERE</literal> clause or a <literal>RETURNING</literal>
         clause, <literal>SELECT</literal> rights are also required on the
         relation being updated and the appropriate <literal>SELECT</literal>
         and <literal>ALL</literal> policies will be combined (using OR for any
         overlapping <literal>SELECT</literal> related policies found) with the
         <literal>USING</literal> clause of the <literal>DELETE</literal> policy
         using AND.  Therefore, in order for a user to be able to
         <literal>DELETE</literal> specific rows, the user must have access
         to the row(s) through a <literal>SELECT</literal>
         or <literal>ALL</literal> policy and the row(s) must pass
         the <literal>DELETE</literal> policy's <literal>USING</>
         expression.
       </para>

       <para>
         A <literal>DELETE</literal> policy cannot have a <literal>WITH
         CHECK</literal> expression, as it only applies in cases where
         records are being deleted from the relation, so that there is no
         new row to check.

  <title>Notes</title>

  <para>
   You must be the owner of a table to create or change policies for it.
  </para>

  <para>
   While policies will be applied for explicit queries against tables
   in the database, they are not applied when the system is performing internal
   referential integrity checks or validating constraints.  This means there are
   indirect ways to determine that a given value exists.  An example of this is
   attempting to insert a duplicate value into a column that is a primary key
   or has a unique constraint.  If the insert fails then the user can infer that
   the value already exists. (This example assumes that the user is permitted by
   policy to insert records which they are not allowed to see.)  Another example
   is where a user is allowed to insert into a table which references another,
   otherwise hidden table.  Existence can be determined by the user inserting
   values into the referencing table, where success would indicate that the
   value exists in the referenced table.  These issues can be addressed by
   carefully crafting policies to prevent users from being able to insert,
   delete, or update records at all which might possibly indicate a value they
   are not otherwise able to see, or by using generated values (e.g., surrogate
   keys) instead of keys with external meanings.
  </para>

  <para>
   Generally, the system will enforce filter conditions imposed using
   security policies prior to qualifications that appear in user queries,
   in order to prevent inadvertent exposure of the protected data to
   user-defined functions which might not be trustworthy.  However,
   functions and operators marked by the system (or the system
   administrator) as <literal>LEAKPROOF</literal> may be evaluated before
   policy expressions, as they are assumed to be trustworthy.
  </para>

  <para>
   Since policy expressions
   are added to the user's query directly, they will be run with the rights of
   the user running the overall query.  Therefore, users who are using a given
   policy must be able to access any tables or functions referenced in the
   expression or they will simply receive a permission denied error when
   attempting to query the table that has row-level security enabled.
   This does not change how views
   work, however.  As with normal queries and views, permission checks and
   policies for the tables which are referenced by a view will use the view
   owner's rights and any policies which apply to the view owner.
